# HNG-Design
I just uploaded a project I was working on. It was based on a tutorial I was following on building a webpage with HTML & CSS. Now I am not a fan of codes, and my work could definitely use some optimizing and I have not even completed it (One of those abandoned endeavours).
But at least I got to learn a thing or two from my inability to understand Git Bash, not for lack of trying.
Maybe one it will come to me. I just gotta keep trying.


PS. Git Bash and any other thing to do with codes are not my priority so I don't expect to make swift headway in a short time. But headway, I will make. (Does taht even make any sense?)
